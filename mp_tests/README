#zipped files because they sparse.

here's a folder with a different test case - this one has a well-behaved equilibrium, which may help identifying the remaining source(s) of inconsistency between the different versions of ORBIT.

Main folder: /p/kick_model/orbit/nstx/204202_jul19/
here you can find the 'spdata' file for the equilibrium.
Specific parameters for this run:
bkg=5.72
pamp=2.8
rprof=3.765
Perturbation file: /p/kick_model/orbit/nstx/204202_jul19/displ_4_5.dat
Results from my previous run: /p/kick_model/orbit/nstx/204202_jul19/displ_4_5/pDEDP.AEP

I'll run a test case with npert=0 as soon as portal cooperates again - I guess that'll be tomorrow morning, after maintenance.
