###################################
here's a folder with a different test case - this one has a well-behaved equilibrium, which may help identifying the remaining source(s) of inconsistency between the different versions of ORBIT.

Main folder: /p/kick_model/orbit/nstx/204202_jul19/
here you can find the 'spdata' file for the equilibrium.
Specific parameters for this run:
bkg=5.72
pamp=2.8
rprof=3.765
Perturbation file: /p/kick_model/orbit/nstx/204202_jul19/displ_4_5.dat
Results from my previous run: /p/kick_model/orbit/nstx/204202_jul19/displ_4_5/pDEDP.AEP

I'll run a test case with npert=0 as soon as portal cooperates again - I guess that'll be tomorrow morning, after maintenance.

# Reference file

To regen a reference file, assuming you have docker,
and are in a directory with the code you care about:

## get the container
docker pull garrettwrong/cuorbit_centos-7
### or build it
docker build -t cuorbit_centos-7 -f ci/Dockerfile.centos7 .


# assuming you are using the prebuild one
## clean and regenerate code in container
docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` garrettwrong/cuorbit_centos-7:latest make clean
docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` garrettwrong/cuorbit_centos-7:latest make -j

## run it in container
docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` garrettwrong/cuorbit_centos-7:latest ./cuOrbit.x reference_test_case/config_short_repro.ini

cp pdedp.nz reference_test_case/pdedp_short_repro.nz
git commit -am "update reference file foo"
git push
